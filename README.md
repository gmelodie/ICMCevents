# OnlineRasp
Framework for running online (public/global) services on a Raspberry Pi

When I bought my [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) I didn't know what to do with it. I like networking in general, but kind of hate sensors, circuits and stuff like that, so what in the world could I do with my rasp? Well, I first learned about [reverse proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy), [dynamic DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dynamic-dns/) and other stuff to make kind of bypass the problems of (1) having an ever changing public IP on my home's router and (2) being behind a [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation).
